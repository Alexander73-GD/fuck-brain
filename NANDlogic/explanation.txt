SVR (Stored Values Row): the second row of the memory in a display of 12 cells per row. This is where the first two inputs and the results of each operation will be saved.

The NAND part consists of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th cell, which I call A, B and C. The inputs go to A and B, the output is saved at C after the operation.

Flag: special cell used for pointer control that makes things easier, specially when combined with the following concept.

+[-<+]- and ++[-->++]-- (or ++[--<++]--) are "gliders", a simple yet incredible idea I saw in mitxela's "AI in Brainfuck" video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK0vmuQib8Y).
The first one moves the pointer to the first cell (a -1), while the second moves it just before the SVR (a -2).

CODE STRUCTURE
Input Replacement: starts and ends at Flag2 (-2, just before the SVR).
NAND operation & Storing Result: can start anywhere (it actually at Flag2) and ends at Flag2.
