I was tricked into learning brainfuck. Here are the results until now:

bfbfbfbfbf.java: Java code that outputs the brainfuck code that outputs the input.

compare.txt: compares the value of 2 characters

dumpster.txt: A bunch of small programs I save (see various.txt for cleaned version).

fibonacci.txt: You guess.

if-else.txt: My journey into writing my first program.

various.txt: Assortment of small programs with comments.
