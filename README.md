I was tricked into learning brainfuck. Here are the results until now:

collatz.txt: Collatz sequence.

compare.txt: compares the value of 2 characters.

divide.txt: simple division with integer result.

divmod.txt: complex division with quotient and remainder.

dumpster.txt: A bunch of small programs I save (see various.txt for cleaned version).

factorial.txt: Factorial and summation as a bonus.

fibonacci.txt: Fibonacci sequence.

if-else.txt: My journey into writing my first program.

print(ASCII).txt: outputs the ASCII value of a character.

text-to-bf.java: Java code that outputs the brainfuck code that outputs the input.

various.txt: Assortment of small programs with comments.

Important note: all of this is a personal project made for fun.
It's not supposed to be useful nor good, this is simply someone who discovered brainfuck and started messing around with it.
